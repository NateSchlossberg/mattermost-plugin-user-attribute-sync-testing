# AGENTS.md

Detailed context for AI agents working on this codebase. [README.md](README.md) is the source of truth for what the plugin does and how it is used.

## What This Project Is

A **Mattermost plugin that creates plugin-managed user and channel attributes and fills them in from a JSON file.** It exists to set up test environments that need attributes the System Console cannot create: `protected` attributes, and the `source_only` and `shared_only` access modes that are only available on them. The attributes appear on user profiles in the UI and are addressable from attribute-based access control (ABAC) policy rules as `user.attributes.<field_name>` (user attributes) and `resource.attributes.<field_name>` (channel attributes) — which is why the plugin writes into the `access_control` property group.

It is a fork of `mattermost-plugin-user-attribute-sync-starter-template` and is no longer a template. Guidance written for someone building their own plugin does not belong here; guidance for someone loading attributes into a test server does.

It ships **one data source**: a JSON file uploaded through the System Console into the plugin KV store, read by `ReadStoredAttributes`. Uploading is the only way to give the plugin data — a filesystem source would be awkward or impossible to deploy in some environments anyway, since Cloud installations give no direct filesystem access and container filesystems are ephemeral, so a file placed next to the server would not survive a restart. Supporting the upload is what pulls in the rest of the machinery: a custom admin console setting, a plugin HTTP API, and server-side storage.

**Plugin ID:** `com.mattermost.user-attribute-sync-test-tool`
**Min Mattermost version:** 12.0.0 (the `graph` field type requires it). Until a v12 `server/public` is published, `go.mod` reads that module from a local checkout of the `dk-graph-property-fields` branch through a `replace` directive — never hand-edit that checkout, it is read-only reference.
**License:** Enterprise Advanced, for ABAC. Every field and value operation on the `access_control` group requires a license, so the plugin fails at activation without one. Channel fields need this tier specifically: below it every channel field is skipped and counted in `FieldsSkipped`, and the rest of the document still syncs.
**Languages:** Go 1.26.3+ (server), TypeScript/React (webapp)

## Architecture

```text
Plugin Activation (Once)
  ├─> Register HTTP routes (mux router on ServeHTTP)
  └─> If a document is stored: SyncDocument under syncLock (fields then values)
      With no document: skip (ErrNoStoredDocument)

System Console (Admin, on demand)
  └─> Custom "Attributes" setting (webapp)
        └─> Upload / download / delete the stored file
              └─> Plugin HTTP API ──> KV store, then SyncDocument (upload) or field wipe (delete)
                    └─> Response is the sync summary the panel renders
```

The plugin has one sync path, `SyncDocument`:
1. **Field sync** — If a document is stored (or just uploaded), applies `fields.user` and `fields.channel` as this plugin's schema (create/update, and delete plugin-owned fields the document omits). With no document, activation skips entirely. Channel fields are gated on an Enterprise Advanced license: below that tier every channel field is skipped and counted in `FieldsSkipped`, and the rest of the document still syncs.
2. **Value sync** — Writes per-user and per-channel values from the same document, using the field-ID caches from the field passes.

Upload and activation both call `runSync()`, which reads the stored document and runs `SyncDocument` under `syncLock` so two triggers cannot interleave their property-service writes. The System Console setting is the UI for that API: upload stores then syncs and shows the summary; delete is a full reset.

All fields and values are stored in the `access_control` property group (`model.AccessControlPropertyGroupName`), with `ObjectType=user` or `ObjectType=channel` and `TargetType=system`. Living in that group is what makes the fields addressable from ABAC policy expressions.

## Key Files and Their Roles

### Server (Go)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `server/plugin.go` | Plugin struct, `OnActivate`. Initializes the API router, looks up the property group, and calls `runSync()`. |
| `server/http_hooks.go` | `ServeHTTP` + `initializeAPI()`. The `gorilla/mux` router and the four `/attributes` handlers, the sysadmin permission check, and the JSON response helpers. Upload stores then syncs; delete wipes plugin-owned fields. |
| `server/job.go` | `runSync()` — reads the stored document, parses it, calls `sync.SyncDocument()`. Holds `syncLock` for the whole read-and-sync. |
| `server/configuration.go` | Thread-safe config management with RWMutex. The struct has no settings; `OnConfigurationChange` still loads it. |
| `server/sync/field_sync.go` | Schema reconciliation from the stored document's `fields.user` and `fields.channel`. Creates/updates fields for the given object type and, after both passes, deletes plugin-owned fields the document omits (`DeleteOmittedFields`, keep-list keyed by object type and name). Maintains `FieldIDCache` mapping external names to Mattermost-generated IDs and declared types. Counts created/updated/deleted/skipped on `Summary`. |
| `server/sync/value_sync.go` | `SyncUsers()` and `SyncChannels()` — match by email or by team plus channel name, build PropertyValue objects, bulk upsert. Handles text, date, multiselect, and rank value types. Counts synced and skipped users and channels on `Summary`. |
| `server/sync/sync.go` | `Summary` and `SyncDocument()` — user then channel field sync, one deletion pass, then user then channel values. Channel field sync is skipped below Enterprise Advanced. |
| `server/sync/document.go` | `ParseAttributesDocument()` decodes the uploaded bytes into `version`, `fields.user`, `fields.channel`, `users`, and `channels`, rejecting anything that is not a JSON object or carries an unsupported `version`. The one parser shared by the upload handler and `runSync`, so the two cannot disagree about what a valid document is. |
| `server/sync/kv_store_provider.go` | Owns the KV key (`AttributesStoreKey`), the `StoredAttributes` value stored under it, `ReadStoredAttributes`, and `ErrNoStoredDocument`. |
| `server/main.go` | Plugin entry point (minimal). |
| `server/manifest.go` | Auto-generated from plugin.json — do not edit manually. |

### Webapp (TypeScript/React)

The webapp exists only to render the custom `Attributes` setting in the System Console. There is no channel/RHS/post UI.

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `webapp/src/index.tsx` | Plugin registration. `registerAdminConsoleCustomSetting('Attributes', UploadUserAttributes, {showTitle: true})` — the one hook this plugin uses. |
| `webapp/src/components/upload_user_attributes.tsx` | The upload panel, mounted directly as the custom setting. Client-side validation (10 MB cap, must parse as a JSON object carrying the supported `version`), then upload/download/delete against the plugin HTTP API. Probes `/attributes/status` on mount to show whether a document is already stored and when it was uploaded. After upload or delete, renders the sync summary from the response body. Takes `disabled` but deliberately not `setByEnv` — see Admin Console Setting below. |
| `webapp/src/components/confirm_modal.tsx` | Local `react-bootstrap` confirm dialog, used to gate deletion. |
| `webapp/src/components/*.scss` | Styles for the above. `webapp/src/types/scss.d.ts` declares `*.scss` so TypeScript accepts the side-effect imports. |
| `webapp/src/manifest.ts` | Auto-generated from plugin.json — do not edit manually. |

### E2E (Playwright)

`e2e/` is a standalone npm project (its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.eslintrc.json`) driving the System Console setting through a real browser against a real server. `e2e/README.md` is the authoritative guide — prerequisites, layout, and the conventions it holds itself to (page objects only, accessibility-first locators, API-driven setup, `workers: 1` because saving admin console settings is a read-modify-write of the server-wide config).

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `e2e/constants.ts` | Base URL, admin credentials, plugin ID, fixture paths. Mirrors constants in `plugin.json`. |
| `e2e/utils.ts` | REST helpers — login, enable plugin, patch a plugin setting, upload/delete the stored file. |
| `e2e/global-setup.ts` / `global-teardown.ts` | Log in once, save the admin storage state, enable the plugin; remove the state file afterwards. |
| `e2e/pages/plugin_settings_page.ts` | The only page object. All locators for the plugin's settings section live here. |
| `e2e/tests/settings.spec.ts` | The upload panel renders. |
| `e2e/tests/attributes.spec.ts` | Upload/download/delete round trips, invalid-document rejection, delete-confirmation behaviour, sync summary on upload and reset. |
| `e2e/assets/` | Deliberately invalid fixtures. The valid fixture is the repo's own `data/attributes.json`. |

### Build & Config

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `plugin.json` | Plugin manifest: ID, version, executables, settings schema. |
| `Makefile` | Build orchestration (~420 lines). All build/test/deploy commands. |
| `build/setup.mk` | Extracts PLUGIN_ID, PLUGIN_VERSION, HAS_SERVER, HAS_WEBAPP from plugin.json. |
| `build/pluginctl/` | Tool for local Mattermost deployment. |
| `data/attributes.json` | Example attributes document: `fields.user` plus sample user records. Channel fields are documented in README.md rather than here, so e2e field-count assertions do not depend on license tier. |

## Field Definitions

Come from `fields.user` and `fields.channel` in the uploaded document — same field-definition shape on both lists. `data/attributes.json` is the example user set (same four attributes a test environment typically wants); channel examples live in README.md:

1. **Job Title** — `job_title`, Text type, Public access
2. **Programs** — `programs`, Multiselect type, SharedOnly access, options: Apples/Oranges/Lemons/Grapes
3. **Clearance** — `clearance`, Rank type, SharedOnly access, options: CUI(1)/Confidential(2)/Secret(3)/Top Secret(4)
4. **Start Date** — `start_date`, Date type, SourceOnly access

`protected` is always `true` and is not a document field. `visibility`, `access_mode`, `permission_field`, `permission_values`, and `permission_options` are optional and default to `always`, public, and `sysadmin`. Accepted values: visibility `always` / `hidden` / `when_set`; access mode `public` / `source_only` / `shared_only`; permission levels `none` / `sysadmin` / `member` / `admin`. `shared_only` with `permission_values: member` is rejected by the server; that field is skipped and logged, and the rest of the document still syncs.

The uploaded document is the full list of fields this plugin owns: a plugin-owned field it omits is deleted with its values. This is per object type: a document that defines `fields.user` but no `fields.channel` deletes the plugin's channel fields, and the reverse. Fields owned by an admin or another plugin are left alone. It is not the full list of values — a user or channel the document does not mention keeps existing values; values disappear only when their field does. With no document stored, activation skips field sync, so a restart cannot delete attributes.

Field types cannot be changed after creation (a Mattermost limitation). To change one, upload a document that omits the field (deletes it and its values), then upload again with the new type.

### Access Modes

- **Public**: Everyone can read all values
- **SharedOnly**: Users only see values they share with the target (select, multiselect, and rank only; on rank, a user sees their own rank and lower)
- **SourceOnly**: Only this plugin can read values via API

## Data Flow

1. `OnActivate()` calls `initializeAPI()` to build the HTTP router, then `runSync()`
2. `runSync()` holds `syncLock`, reads the stored document via `ReadStoredAttributes`, parses it, and calls `SyncDocument()`. No document is `ErrNoStoredDocument` — activation logs and continues; the HTTP routes stay up.
3. `SyncDocument()` runs `SyncFields()` for users, then for channels if licensed, then `DeleteOmittedFields`, then `SyncUsers()` and `SyncChannels()`, accumulating a `Summary`. Each field pass has its own field-ID cache, used immediately for that object type's values and not kept on the plugin. Below Enterprise Advanced the channel field pass is skipped (`FieldsSkipped`) and `SyncChannels` still runs against an empty cache, so channel values land in `ChannelsSkipped`.
4. `SyncUsers()` iterates users, looks up each by email, calls `buildPropertyValues()` to create `PropertyValue` objects, then bulk upserts via `Property.UpsertPropertyValues()`. `SyncChannels()` does the same after `Channel.GetByNameForTeamName(team, channel)`.
5. For fields with options (select, multiselect, rank), option names are translated to option IDs using `FieldIDCache`

Upload is the same path after the KV write: `handleUploadAttributes` stores the bytes, then `runSync()`, and answers `201` with the `Summary`. `handleDeleteAttributes` takes the same lock, deletes the KV key first, then `DeleteOmittedFields` with an empty keep-list so every plugin-owned field (and its values) is removed.

**Invariants worth knowing before changing sync code:**

- `email` is the join key between external data and Mattermost users; `team` and `channel` are the join keys for channel records. They are consumed by `SyncUsers()` / `SyncChannels()` and listed as identity keys so `buildPropertyValue()` never writes them as attributes. Changing the identity strategy means touching both.
- A `FieldIDCache` is built per object type during field sync inside `SyncDocument` and used immediately for that type's value sync. External names → Mattermost-generated field IDs; option names → option IDs; `FieldNameToType` holds the type declared in the document. A cache miss on a field name is a skip-with-warning; a cache miss on an *option* name is an error for that value.
- Value JSON shape is type-dependent: text and date are marshaled strings; multiselect is an array of option **IDs**, not names; rank is a single option **ID** string, so a rank value looks like a text value on the wire and is only distinguishable by consulting the field definition.
- `FieldNameToType` on `FieldIDCache` is how value sync recovers a field's declared type from the document's key. Adding an option-bearing field type means updating the value-formatting switch in `buildPropertyValue()` together with how field sync records the type, or values will be written as raw names instead of option IDs.
- Failure handling is per-record and per-field: unknown fields, unsupported value types, format errors, missing users or channels, and upsert failures all log and continue. `SyncUsers()` and `SyncChannels()` return `nil` unless something structural goes wrong — a "successful" sync can have written nothing. Those skips still increment `UsersSkipped` / `ChannelsSkipped` / `FieldsSkipped` on the summary.
- `syncLock` serializes `runSync()` (activation and upload) and `handleDeleteAttributes`. The lock covers the stored-document read as well as the property-service writes, so two triggers cannot interleave.
- An upload stores the document, then syncs it, and the response body is the `Summary` the console renders. A stored document whose sync then fails is still stored (`500`, "document stored but sync failed") — activation will retry it.
- `ErrNoStoredDocument` is the empty-store case (`len(Data) == 0`), not a parse error. Activation treats it as skip-with-info; `runSync` callers that expected a document they just wrote treat any error as failure.
- One KV key, `AttributesStoreKey` (`attributes`), holds a `StoredAttributes` — the uploaded bytes and the timestamp the status endpoint reports, written and deleted as one value. `ReadStoredAttributes` is the only reader: it decodes the raw value itself rather than letting `KV.Get` unmarshal in place, which would surface an unreachable store and a corrupt value as the same error. An unset key is neither — `KV.Get` returns no error and leaves the target untouched, so "nothing uploaded" is the `len(Data) == 0` case.
- `pluginapi`'s `KV.Set` stores raw bytes only when handed a `[]byte` and JSON-encodes anything else, so the document is base64 inside the envelope — roughly a third larger in the database than on disk. `json.RawMessage` would avoid that, at the cost of `json.Marshal` compacting the JSON and so breaking the byte-for-byte download.
- **`ParseAttributesDocument` is the single place that decides what a valid document is**, shared by the upload handler and the sync path, so the two cannot drift into accepting different things. It decodes `version`, `fields.user`, `fields.channel`, `users`, and `channels`; omitted lists stay empty.

## HTTP API

Registered in `server/http_hooks.go` on a `gorilla/mux` router, served through the `ServeHTTP` plugin hook. Full paths are prefixed `/plugins/com.mattermost.user-attribute-sync-test-tool`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `POST` | `/attributes` | Upload the attributes document into the KV store, then sync it. Body is the raw JSON document. `201` is the `Summary`. Store-then-sync-fail is `500` with the document still stored. |
| `GET` | `/attributes` | Download the stored document verbatim. `404` when nothing is stored. |
| `GET` | `/attributes/status` | `{"exists": bool, "lastUpdated": time\|null}` — lets the UI show whether a document is stored, and how current it is, without downloading it. |
| `DELETE` | `/attributes` | Remove the stored document, then every field this plugin owns. `200` is the `Summary` (field-delete counts filled in). |

Things to preserve when changing these:

- **The sysadmin check is router middleware, not per-handler.** `initializeAPI` applies `requireSysadmin` via `router.Use`, so a route added later is protected by default rather than depending on the author remembering. It reads the `Mattermost-User-Id` header — the only header the plugin can trust, because the Mattermost server sets it on the way in and strips any client-supplied value — and requires `model.PermissionManageSystem`. Two consequences: the whole router is admin-only, so a genuinely public route needs the protected routes moved to a subrouter with `Use` applied there; and gorilla/mux builds the middleware chain only on a matched route (`Router.Match`), so unknown paths 404 without reaching the check.
- **Uploads are bounded twice.** `http.MaxBytesReader` caps the body at `maxFileSizeBytes` (10 MB) server-side, and the UI checks `MAX_FILE_BYES` (also 10 MB) before sending. The two constants are independent — keep them in step.
- **Validation is shape-only, on both sides, by design.** Server and client both require the payload to unmarshal as a document carrying the supported `version`; neither validates emails, field names, or value types. This is not a gap to close: external data routinely contains a few unusable records, and rejecting the whole document over one of them would mean syncing nothing. Per-record failures are already handled where they belong, in value sync, which logs and continues (see the failure-handling invariant above). Adding record-level validation to the upload endpoint would move that decision to the worst possible place — an all-or-nothing gate in front of otherwise good data.
- The webapp reaches these routes with plain `fetch`, using `Client4.getOptions()` on `POST`/`DELETE` to pick up the CSRF token. `GET`s need no options.

## Admin Console Setting

`plugin.json` declares `Attributes` as `"type": "custom"`, which tells the System Console to render a webapp-supplied component instead of a built-in control. `index.tsx` supplies it via `registry.registerAdminConsoleCustomSetting`, mounting `UploadUserAttributes` directly — the setting holds no value of its own; it exists only because `registerAdminConsoleCustomSetting` needs a `type: custom` entry to mount the panel at all.

- The console passes considerably more props than this component declares (`label`, `helpText`, `config`, `license`, `registerSaveAction`, `setSaveNeeded`, `showConfirm`, …). `upload_user_attributes.tsx` deliberately takes only `id` and `disabled`; the rest are available if a future version needs them (see `schema_admin_settings.tsx`'s `buildCustomSetting` in the server repo). It does not declare `setByEnv` — there is nothing to forward, since the setting holds no value an environment variable could pin.
- The upload/download/delete buttons hit the plugin API directly and take effect immediately; there is no Save button involved, because the setting holds no value for the console to save. Upload and delete responses carry the sync summary, which the panel lists.
- Because `showTitle: true` is passed at registration, the console wraps the component in its own `Setting` (rendering `display_name` as the label and `help_text` beneath it).
- If the plugin is disabled, the webapp component is not registered, and the console renders a warning banner ("In order to view this setting, enable the plugin and click Save") in place of the setting. A blank-looking setting usually means the bundle failed to load, not that the component is broken.

## Adding to the Plugin

### A new attribute
Add an object to `fields.user` or `fields.channel` in the uploaded document and upload it. Select, multiselect, and rank types also need `options` populated; on a rank field every option needs a `rank`, which `buildOptionsArr()` enforces.

### Server-side rules to work within
Enforced by the property service, not by this plugin, so they cannot be worked around from here:

- Every field and value operation on the `access_control` group requires an Enterprise license.
- `protected` and `source_plugin_id` can only be set by a plugin; `source_only` and `shared_only` require `protected`.
- `source_plugin_id` cannot be changed after creation, so fields created under a different plugin ID cannot be adopted by this one — `syncSingleField()` fails with "already exists but is not managed by this plugin".
- While the plugin is installed, only it can delete its own protected fields.

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
make                    # Full build: check-style + test + dist
make test               # Run all tests (Go gotestsum + Node jest). Does NOT run e2e.
make test-e2e           # Playwright e2e — needs a running server with the plugin deployed
make check-style        # golangci-lint + eslint + type checking, for webapp AND e2e
make server             # Compile Go binaries only
make webapp             # Build webapp bundle only
make dist               # Build and create tar.gz bundle
make deploy             # Build + deploy to running Mattermost
make watch              # Rebuild the webapp bundle on change (does not deploy)
make deploy-from-watch  # Install the bundle make watch rebuilt
make clean              # Remove all build artifacts
make install-go-tools   # Install golangci-lint v1.64.8, gotestsum v1.7.0 into $GOBIN
make coverage           # Go coverage profile + open HTML report
make logs / logs-watch  # Fetch / tail plugin logs on running server (via build/pluginctl)
make attach             # Attach delve to the running plugin process (attach-headless, detach)
make disable / enable / reset / kill   # Plugin lifecycle on the running server
make apply              # Regenerate manifest files from plugin.json
make patch|minor|major  # Bump plugin.json version (also *-rc variants)
```

**Running a single test:**

```bash
cd server && go test ./sync/ -run TestSyncUsers -v          # one Go test
cd server && go test ./sync/ -run 'TestReadStoredAttributes_.*' -v  # pattern
cd server && go test . -run 'TestHandle.*' -v               # the HTTP handler tests (package main)
cd webapp && npx jest src/manifest.test.tsx                 # one webapp test
cd e2e && npm test -- tests/settings.spec.ts                # one Playwright spec
cd e2e && npm test -- -g 'renders the upload panel'  # by title
```

`make test`/`make check-style` first run `apply`, install Go tools, and `npm install` — going through `go test` directly is much faster for iteration.

`check-style` now also lints and type-checks `e2e/` (and so depends on `e2e/node_modules`), but that happens inside the `HAS_WEBAPP` guard — a fork that removes the webapp silently stops linting the e2e tests too. `make test-e2e` is separate from `make test` and from CI, because it needs a live server; see `e2e/README.md`.

**Generated files:** `server/manifest.go` and `webapp/src/manifest.ts` are produced by `./build/bin/manifest apply` (run automatically by most Makefile targets). Edit `plugin.json`, then `make apply` — never edit the manifest files by hand. `make manifest-check` validates the manifest.

**Go module path:** `github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-user-attribute-sync-testing` (internal imports use `.../server/sync`, aliased `attrsync` in `plugin.go`). `.golangci.yml`'s `goimports.local-prefixes` matches it, so import grouping for local packages is enforced.

**Environment variables:**
- `MM_DEBUG=1` — Debug build (disables optimizations)
- `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_ENABLEDEVELOPER=1` — Build for current platform only (faster)
- `MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL` — Server URL for deploy
- `MM_ADMIN_TOKEN` — Admin token for deploy
- `MM_SITE_URL` — Server the e2e tests target (default `http://localhost:8065`)
- `MM_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `MM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` — e2e admin credentials (default `sysadmin` / `Sys@dmin-sample1`, what `make test-data` creates in a server checkout)

## Testing Patterns

**Go tests** (`server/*_test.go`, `server/sync/*_test.go`):
- Framework: testify (assert, mock, require)
- Mocking: `plugintest.API` and `plugintest.Driver` from Mattermost
- Pattern: Table-driven tests with `t.Run()`
- Mock expectations with `.On()` and `.Return()`
- Each file has a `newTest*` helper that builds the subject against a fresh `plugintest.API` and registers `t.Cleanup(func() { api.AssertExpectations(t) })`, so unmet expectations fail the test automatically. Follow that shape for new tests.
- `http_hooks_test.go` drives handlers through `p.ServeHTTP` with `httptest`, the same way the server does, rather than calling handler functions directly — so route registration and the permission check are covered too. It sets the `Mattermost-User-Id` header to simulate an authenticated request and mocks `HasPermissionTo` to control authorization.
- `job_test.go` covers `runSync()`: no stored document is `ErrNoStoredDocument`, and a stored document reaches `SyncDocument()`.

**Webapp tests** (`webapp/src/**/*.test.tsx`):
- Framework: **Jest 29 + React Testing Library**, matching the majority of Mattermost plugins (calls, github, gitlab, jira, zoom). Query by role, assert on what the admin can see and do; `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers are registered globally in `tests/setup.tsx`.
- **RTL is pinned to 12.1.5, and cannot be upgraded while this plugin is on React 17.** RTL 13+ declares `peerDependencies: react >=18`. Every RTL-using Mattermost plugin is on React 18 and therefore on RTL 14.x — do not copy their pin without moving React first.
- Enzyme was removed (`enzyme`, `@types/enzyme`, `enzyme-adapter-react-17-updated`, `enzyme-to-json`). It had been an unconfigured devDependency since the initial commit, inherited from the upstream template, which has since dropped it too. The `snapshotSerializers` entry went with it.
- **Two jest resolution problems had to be solved before any component test could run**, and both are worth understanding before adding tests:
  - `mattermost-redux` (and `@mattermost/client` beneath it) expose subpaths via the `exports` field. Jest 27 predates `exports` support, so `mattermost-redux/client` was unresolvable and *nothing* importing `Client4` could be tested. **Upgrading to jest 29 fixed this natively** — no `moduleNameMapper` needed, which is why the other plugins' configs have no entry for it. This is what jest 27 was costing.
  - `react-bootstrap` is a **webpack external** — the host webapp supplies it at runtime, so it is deliberately not installed and jest cannot resolve it. `tests/react_bootstrap_mock.tsx` stands in for it via `moduleNameMapper`, implementing only the `Modal` surface `confirm_modal.tsx` uses. Any future external in `webpack.config.js` that is not also a real dependency needs the same treatment.
  - **Installing react-bootstrap as a devDependency instead was tried and rejected**, and not for bundle-size reasons — `externals` excludes it by configuration, so an install would cost the bundle nothing. It was rejected because (a) Mattermost's webapp uses its own fork, `github:mattermost/react-bootstrap#05559f4c`, so an upstream install would test against a different library than production; and (b) upstream `0.32.4` — the line matching that fork and the pinned `@types/react-bootstrap@0.32.37` — declares `peer react: >=15.3.0`, which npm satisfies with react-dom 19 and then fails against react 17. `--legacy-peer-deps` does install it, but removes `react-dom` from the tree and breaks RTL; the alternative is an `overrides` pin, i.e. exactly the cruft removed with enzyme. The real Modal is covered in `e2e/` against the host's actual fork.
- `upload_user_attributes.test.tsx` renders the **real** component tree, so the assertions are behavioural rather than prop-level. The mount-time `/attributes/status` request is stubbed with a `fetch` mock; `renderPanel` awaits an `act()` flush so the resulting state update does not land after the test ends.
- `react_fragment.test.tsx` was deleted: it asserted `React.version === '17.0.2'`, so it tested nothing about this plugin while guaranteeing a failure on any React upgrade. `manifest.test.tsx` is kept as a smoke test that manifest generation ran.

**E2E tests** (`e2e/tests/*.spec.ts`):
- Framework: Playwright, `workers: 1`, no server started for you
- Read `e2e/README.md` before touching these. The conventions that matter: locators live only in `pages/`, `getByRole`/`getByText` are preferred over `getByTestId`, and per-test setup goes through the REST helpers in `utils.ts` rather than the UI.

## Code Conventions

- **Error handling:** `errors.Wrap(err, "context")` / `errors.Wrapf()` from `github.com/pkg/errors`
- **Logging:** `p.client.Log.Info/Error/Warn/Debug("message", "key", value)`
- **Thread safety:** RWMutex for configuration, defensive cloning before updates
- **Graceful degradation:** Continue on partial failures; never fail entire sync for one user
- **HTTP responses:** JSON via the `errorWithJSON` / `responseWithJSON` helpers in `http_hooks.go`, not hand-written `w.Write`. Download is the deliberate exception — it streams the stored bytes verbatim.
- **Webapp:** function components with hooks, no Redux, literal strings in JSX braces per the Mattermost eslint config, and no i18n — strings are inline rather than translated.
- **No license headers.** Do not add `// Copyright (c) …` / `// See LICENSE.txt …` blocks to any file. No source file in this repo carries one, and `webapp/.eslintrc.json` sets `"header/header": "off"`. Licensing lives in `LICENSE` at the repo root.
- **No template framing in comments.** Comments should not address a reader who is about to fork the repo or build their own plugin; that framing was swept out of the codebase and should not come back.

## Mattermost API Surface

Used via `pluginapi.Client`:

- `Property.GetPropertyGroup(name)` — Fetch the `access_control` property group
- `Property.SearchPropertyFields(groupID, opts)` — Page fields in the group; `ObjectTypes` filters user vs channel so a shared name does not collide
- `Property.CreatePropertyField(field)` — Create field (returns generated ID)
- `Property.UpdatePropertyField(groupID, field)` — Modify existing field
- `Property.UpsertPropertyValues(values)` — Bulk write attribute values
- `Property.DeletePropertyValuesForField` / `DeletePropertyField` — Wipe an omitted field's values then the field
- `User.GetByEmail(email)` — Find user by email
- `Channel.GetByNameForTeamName(teamName, channelName, includeDeleted)` — Resolve a channel record
- `System.GetLicense()` — Channel field sync checks `MinimumEnterpriseAdvancedLicense` against this
- `User.HasPermissionTo(userID, permission)` — The sysadmin gate on every HTTP route
- `KV.Set/Get/Delete(key, …)` — Storage behind `ReadStoredAttributes` and the upload API. Note `KV.Set` returns `(bool, error)`: a `false` with no error means the write did not happen, and callers here treat that as a failure.
- `Log.Info/Warn/Error/Debug` — Structured logging

Plugin hooks implemented: `OnActivate`, `OnConfigurationChange`, `ServeHTTP`.

## Key Dependencies

**Go:**
- `github.com/mattermost/mattermost/server/public` — Plugin API, model types
- `github.com/gorilla/mux` — HTTP routing behind `ServeHTTP`
- `github.com/pkg/errors` — Error wrapping (note `http_hooks.go` and `kv_store_provider.go` use stdlib `errors`/`fmt.Errorf` with `%w` instead)
- `github.com/stretchr/testify` — Testing

**Node:**
- React 17, Redux, mattermost-redux, @mattermost/types
- `react-bootstrap` — used only by `confirm_modal.tsx`. It is a **webpack external** (`webpack.config.js` maps it to the host's `ReactBootstrap` global, like `react` and `redux`), so it is not installed; only `@types/react-bootstrap` is a devDependency, and it exists purely so `tsc` can resolve the import. Adding the real package would not change the bundle, but see the testing notes above for why it is still not worth doing
- Webpack, Babel, TypeScript, ESLint, Jest
- `e2e/` has its own tree: `@playwright/test`, TypeScript, ESLint + `@typescript-eslint`
